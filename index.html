        <p>For thousands of years, the night sky has meant different things for cultures around the year.</p>
        <p>In our video below, we explore what other cultures may have seen when they looked up at the sky (Not literally of course).</p>

        <h2>A very lucid dream</h2>
        <p>
          What if you could zoom in on the sky? In this video, we explore this idea. Using artificial intellegence, we created images of what past cultures may have imagined was up in the sky. The ancient Egyptian's imagined that the stars were the souls of their pharaohs. What would that look like? The Christians believed that the stars were a gateway to heaven. How could that be? When we look up at the sky, we imagine endless possibilities of what could be out there.
